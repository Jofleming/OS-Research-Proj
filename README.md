# OS Research Project

**Purpose:** To practice and demonstrate proficiency in understanding concepts related to operating systems.

**Skills Used:** Research, report writing

**Knowledge Goals:** To learn more about operating systems concepts through research and the analysis of two modern operating systems.

 

## Summary
Select, research, and compare two existing operating systems of your choice. Your team will be presenting on one of the operating systems in class. You will have to sign up to present your operating system and once one is chosen, no other group can choose it.

Operating systems to pick from (also you can pick a separate one with permission):

Windows
macOS
UNIX (This is the base for many operating systems. If you choose this, providing details for UNIX in general would be the goal.)
Linux (any distro)
Ubuntu (Linux Distro)
Fedora (Linux Distro)
Android
iOS
Blackberry OS
 

We picked **macOS**

Use at least six technical research sources (Wikipedia is NOT a technical reference) properly referenced. 

 

**Project Specifications are as follows:**

  * Introduction – describe the Operating Systems, give examples of types of computer systems that use this OS and what are the requirements of these systems (example: hard real time, small size, etc.). (1 to 2 pages)
    
  * What is the OS architecture (microkernel, layered, modular, or combination)?
  * How are the major components of the system structured in the OS architecture? (1 to 2 pages)
  * Describe some of the major functions of the system, discuss how they relate to the type of system. (4 to 6 pages)Some suggestions below – discuss topics of interest/relate to topics discussed in class:
      * Process descriptor and states
      * Threading – does the system support threading?
      * Schedulers (long term, short term)?
      * Scheduling algorithms used (Priority, Round Robin, MLQ, MLFQ, new algorithm)
      * Synchronization techniques? Semaphores?
      * How does the system handle deadlocks?
      * Memory organization and management
      * Mass storage

  * Evaluate the design. What is good about it? What are its limitations? How would you extend it? (1 to 3 pages)

  * Prepare a PowerPoint presentation to present to the class.

  * References.

 

Note: there will be no performance reviews on teammates for this project, but if it comes to my attention, I reserve the right to adjust your grade based on your contribution to the final project.
